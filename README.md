# quantitative_risk_management
R scripts for projects (Extreme Value Model, Investment Portfolio Risk) of the course "Risk Management" (M.Sc. in Applied Statistics).
In these projects, I make use of the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES).
Specifically, the first project includes the following: Construction of the block-maxima, goodness-of-fit test, parameter estimation for the GEV distribution using the block maxima, parameter estimation for the GPD using POT (Peaks Over Threshold), estimation of the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES) using POT and their empirical estimators.
The second project includes: Estimation of the expected portfolio performance, estimation of the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES) for given synthesis, portfolio optimization, estimation of the beta coefficients and the variance-covariance matrix, estimation of the VaR, ES and the expected performance using the beta coefficients.
